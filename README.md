Overview

This project focuses on cleaning, merging, and analyzing multiple datasets containing employee, project, and designation details. The goal is to perform end-to-end data preprocessing and analysis using Python libraries to generate accurate and insightful results.

Objective

To integrate raw and inconsistent datasets, handle missing values, and derive meaningful insights through structured data manipulation techniques.

Process

Data Preparation: Created and loaded multiple datasets using Pandas DataFrames.

Data Cleaning: Handled missing values using running averages and corrected inconsistencies.

Data Integration: Merged employee, project, and designation data into a single comprehensive DataFrame.

Conditional Operations: Applied logic for employee promotions/demotions and bonus calculations.

Analysis: Generated summary reports such as total project costs and filtered insights by city and status.

Tools and Skills

Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Jupyter Notebook
Skills: Data Cleaning, Data Transformation, Data Integration, Conditional Logic, Analytical Reporting

Outcome

Successfully delivered a unified, accurate dataset and insights dashboard demonstrating strong proficiency in Python-based data preprocessing, analysis, and automation workflows.
